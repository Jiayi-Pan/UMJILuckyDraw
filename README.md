> Endlessly refreshing the website or anxiously waiting for the empty-slot email is a waste of time.  A proper course-selection system should avoid such issue by DESIGN.

> This script acts not only as a temporal solution to the problem, but also a gentle signal encouraging an official solution.

Built for UM-SJTU JI students :)

A simple JS script to register your desired course when slots are available

## Get Started
1. Install via [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/zh-TW/scripts/420920-umji-lucky-draw) or directly add the script to tampermonkey.
2. enter the course selection page (containing the course list), 
3. find your desired courses' ```lessontaskid``` by "inspect element",
6. add it to the script's ```wantedlessonTaskID``` array,
7. wait until luck comes :)

## Feature Road Map
- Add support to drop a specific course when course collision happens at selection stage
